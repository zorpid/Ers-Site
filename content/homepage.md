title: "ERS - ENDLESS REFERENCE SCALE"
---

This Logo is made on the logo from Kurt Moebius and is a version of the mathematic theorem “Moebius strip” end of 1960. Inventor Kurt Moebius, inventor of LOKRING. 3 first on the moon (Apollo project), today 3000 million/year.

Since Erik Moebus founded [www.hemomatik.se](http://www.hemomatik.se) in 1973, we used the same symbol but I sold this company in 2024.

Same symbol in green is used for [www.endlessgreen.se](http://www.endlessgreen.se), saving the planet. In blue we use it for [www.endlesssolution.se](http://www.endlesssolution.se) where we develop, sell, and produce systems and sensors for better environment.

The shop is non-profit to get money for EndlessGreenPrize. It is built on the 4 elements: air, water, soil, and fire.

Endless Reference Scale is a tendency scale to get “Early Warning” and collect data over time. Similar to a traffic light. It is used for our sensors connected to the cloud.

One good example is our GWS GroundWaterSensor connected to the cloud and cellphone. The intention is to build up a database that can be used for research or tendency warning. There is one million drilled wells only in Sweden.

For air we have CO₂ and pollution sensors. For agriculture we will have different tree- and soil-sensors.

Future is “get FACT then ACT“. We all depend on animals, nature, water and air.

Erik

I cannot do this by myself, but internet and good collaborators with common goals can get things moving.
